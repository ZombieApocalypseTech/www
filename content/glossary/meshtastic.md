An open-source mesh networking project that runs on [LoRa](/glossary/lora) radio hardware. Enables off-grid text messaging, GPS location sharing, and telemetry between devices over distances of several kilometers. [ZAC](/glossary/zac) communicates with any Meshtastic-compatible device, creating decentralized communication networks that don't rely on cell towers or internet.
