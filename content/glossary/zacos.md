ZAC Operating System

The open-source application that powers [ZAC](/glossary/zac). Mother brain. Provides a unified interface for offline AI, mesh communication, radio monitoring, navigation, and environmental sensing. Built to run entirely without internet connectivity.

Old Man: The ZACOS setup process currently requires access to [LIA](/glossary/lazarus-internet-archive) in order to download software packages. Realizing this is not ideal for fully-autonomous bootstrapping, I have been working on ways to distribute these files with ZACOS itself. In the meantime, if you are unable to access the LIA mirrors, email oldman@zombieapocalypse.tech and I'll find a way to get the setup packages to you.
