**ZACOS** (ZAC Operating System) - The open-source application that powers [ZAC](/glossary/zac). Provides a unified interface for offline AI, mesh communication, radio monitoring, navigation, and environmental sensing. Built to run entirely without internet connectivity.

Old Man: The ZACOS setup process currently requires access to [LIA](/glossary/lazarus-internet-archive) to download software packages. Knowing this is not ideal for fully-autonomous bootstrapping, we have been working on ways to distribute these files with ZACOS itself. In the meantime, if you are unable to access LIA mirrors, email oldman@zombieapocalypse.tech and we'll find a way to get the setup packages to you.
