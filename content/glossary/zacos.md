**ZACOS** (ZAC Operating System) - The open-source application that powers [ZAC](/glossary/zac). Provides a unified interface for offline AI, mesh communication, radio monitoring, navigation, and environmental sensing. Built to run entirely without internet connectivity.

Note from the Old Man: The setup process currently requires access to [LIA](/glossary/lazarus-internet-archive) for certain software packages, though we are working on a way to distribute these files through local mesh networks. If you are unable to access LIA mirrors, or equivalent internet archives, please email oldman@zombieapocalypse.tech and we will find a way to get the necessary files to you.
