**Zombie**  - Not merely the walking dead, a zombie is any force destructive to our world. Eater of the planet, the body, the mind, and the spirit. That’s why I still build things. Especially now. The things I create remind me of the world we lost, but also the world as it could be again. Just because everything has gone to hell in a handbasket, doesn’t mean we have to give in to the bastards. Don’t ever give in, kid.
