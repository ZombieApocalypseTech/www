**Zombie**  - A human who has become something not quite human. The zombie's behavior is erratic to a harmful degree. It retains memories and knowledge from its former life, but no connections. Nothing means anything. It follows the same routine as it did in life, but everything is jumbled and wrong somehow. Despite what popular media has suggested, a zombie is not always hungry, but when so, it seems to have no comprehension of food. It will consume anything and everything in sight. That includes other zombies. And you. Because of this, a zombie more often than not succumbs to starvation eventually, though increasingly ravenous to the end.
