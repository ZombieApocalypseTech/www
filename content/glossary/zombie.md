A human who has become something not quite human.

The zombie's behavior is erratic to a harmful degree, retaining memories and knowledge from before the turn, but disconnected. It generally follows the same routine as it did in life, but its actions have been described as "jumbled and wrong somehow". Absurd.

A zombie is always starving, because it seems unable to distinguish food from non-food. Therefore, it will consume anything and everything in sight. That includes other zombies. Other humans. You.

Because of these characteristics, a zombie more often than not succumbs to starvation eventually, ravenous to the end.
