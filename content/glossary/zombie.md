**Zombie**  - A human that has become something not quite human. Their behavior is erratic and unpredictable, to a harmful degree. They retain memories and knowledge from their former lives, but nothing seems connected, nor has any meaning to them. A typical zombie follows the same routine as they did in life, but it's all jumbled and wrong. Despite what popular media has shown, a zombie is not constantly hungry, but when they do need to feed, they have no understanding of nourishment. Consequently, they'll eat anything and everything in sight. That includes you. See also, [The Turning](/glossary/turning).

Note from the Old Man: A zombie is not merely the walking dead. It is any force destructive to our world. Eater of the planet, the body, the mind, and the spirit. That’s why I still build things. Especially now. The things I create remind me of the world we lost, but also the world as it could be again. Just because everything has gone to hell in a handbasket, doesn’t mean we have to give in to the bastards. Don’t ever give in, kid.
