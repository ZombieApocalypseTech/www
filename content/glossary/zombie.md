**Zombie**  - A human who has become something not quite human. Its behavior is erratic to a harmful degree. It retains memories and knowledge from its former life, but no connections. Nothing means anything. It follows the same routine as it did in life, but everything is jumbled and wrong somehow. Despite what popular media has suggested, a zombie is not always hungry, but when so, it seems to have no comprehension of food. It will consume anything and everything in sight. That includes you. Because of this, a zombie more often than not succumbs to starvation eventually, though increasingly ravenous to the end.

Note from the Old Man: A zombie is not merely the walking dead. It is any force destructive to our world. Eater of the planet, the body, the mind, and the spirit. That’s why I still build things. Especially now. The things I create remind me of the world we lost, but also the world as it could be again. Just because everything has gone to hell in a handbasket, doesn’t mean we have to give in to the bastards. Don’t ever give in, kid.
