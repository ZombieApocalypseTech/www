A human who has become something not quite human.

The zombie's behavior is erratic to a harmful degree, retaining knowledge and memories from before the turn, but disconnected. It generally follows the same routine as it did in life, but its actions have been described as "jumbled and wrong somehow". Absurd.

The zombie is always starving, as it seems unable to distinguish food from non-food. Therefore, it will consume anything in sight. That includes other zombies. Other humans. You.

Because of these characteristics, the zombie, more often than not, eventually succumbs to starvation, ravenous to the end.
