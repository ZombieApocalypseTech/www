## Introduction

Welcome to Phase 01 of the [ZAC](/glossary/zac) project. This is where it begins, so if you can't tell a hawk from a handsaw, don't worry, you're in the right place.

Phase 01 is building a functional POC (proof of concept) of ZAC. This serves two purposes. First is to give us a bird's-eye view of ZAC as a system of hardware/software, working together. Second is to make sure we're not crazy to even attempt building something this complex, because the jury's still out on that one.

There are two parts in Phase 01. When you're ready, continue on to the [Goals](#goals) for Part One, *Hello, ZAC!*

Let's do this, amigo.
