## Introduction

Welcome to Phase 01 of the [ZAC](/glossary/zac) project. This is where it all begins, so if you don't know what the hell's going on, don't worry, you're in the right place.

Phase 01 is all about building a functional POC (proof of concept) of ZAC. This serves two purposes. First is to give us an overview of ZAC as a working system of hardware and software, reading input and displaying output. Second is to make sure we're not crazy, because the jury's still out on that one.

This is a two-parter. When you're ready, continue to the [Goals](#goals) section to begin Part One — Hello, ZAC!

Let's do this, amigo.

## Goals

By the end, we'll have:

- A running Raspberry Pi
- Remote access via VNC and SSH
- A Node.js API serving "Hello, ZAC!"
- A React app displaying it in the browser

Easy-peasy.
