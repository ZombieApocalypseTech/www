ZAC is an open-source, self-contained survival computer designed to operate completely off-grid.

Built around a Raspberry Pi / Mini PC architecture, ZAC integrates a local AI assistant, mesh radio communication, software-defined radio, offline knowledge archives, and GPS navigation into a ruggedized Pelican case. Solar and battery powered. No internet required. No cloud dependencies. No subscriptions. A true standalone, civilization-in-a-box, built to outlast the apocalypse.

ZACOS provides a unified interface for all system functions:

- Local LLM for queries and assistance
- Offline Wikipedia, survival references, and medical guides
- LoRa mesh communication with other ZAC units
- SDR for monitoring aircraft, weather satellites, and emergency broadcasts
- GPS navigation with offline maps

Fully open source. Fully offline. Field-serviceable.
