Or, the *Zero-Infrastructure Autonomous Computer*, if you prefer.

I just call it [ZAC](/glossary/zac).

A self-contained, open-source survival computer designed to function completely off-grid.

Built around a [Raspberry Pi](/glossary/raspberry-pi) architecture, ZAC lives in a weatherproof [Pelican](/glossary/pelican) case. Solar and battery powered. No internet required. No cloud dependencies. No subscriptions. A standalone, civilization-in-a-box machine, constructed to outlast the zombie apocalypse.

[ZACOS](/glossary/zacos) is the application that brings ZAC to life, providing a unified interface for all system capabilities:

- Ask questions and get answers from a [Local LLM](/glossary/llm)—no internet required
- Access offline [Wikipedia](/glossary/wikipedia), survival references, and medical guides
- Communicate over [LoRa](/glossary/lora) mesh with any [Meshtastic](/glossary/meshtastic)-compatible device
- Monitor aircraft, weather satellites, and emergency broadcasts via [SDR](/glossary/sdr)
- Navigate anywhere with offline maps and [GPS](/glossary/gps)
- Track environmental conditions: temperature, humidity, pressure
- Activate emergency beacon mode when things go sideways
- Expand functionality via [USB](/glossary/usb) sensor modules

Fully open source. Fully offline. Field-serviceable, with a printable manual, including schematics and repair guides.

That's what we're gonna build. Sounds badass, right? When you're ready to begin, [let's fucking go](/blog/zaclog-01-01).
