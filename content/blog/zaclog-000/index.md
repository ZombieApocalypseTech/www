[ZAC](/glossary/zac) is a self-contained, open-source survival computer designed to function completely off-grid.

Built around a Raspberry Pi 5 architecture, ZAC lives in a weatherproof Pelican case. Solar and battery powered. No internet required. No cloud dependencies. No subscriptions. A standalone, civilization-in-a-box machine constructed to outlast the zombie apocalypse.

[ZACOS](/glossary/zacos) is the operating system that brings ZAC to life, providing a unified interface for all system capabilities:

- Ask questions and get answers from a local LLM—no internet required
- Access offline Wikipedia, survival references, and medical guides
- Communicate over [LoRa](/glossary/lora) mesh with any Meshtastic-compatible device
- Monitor aircraft, weather satellites, and emergency broadcasts via [SDR](/glossary/sdr)
- Navigate anywhere with offline maps and GPS
- Track environmental conditions: temperature, humidity, pressure
- Activate emergency beacon mode when things go sideways
- Expand functionality via USB sensor modules

Fully open source. Fully offline. Field-serviceable, with a printed manual including schematics and repair guides.

This post kicks off [ZACLOG](/glossary/zaclog), our build series documenting the ZAC project from first boot to field-ready. Join the email list to follow along.

Until then...
