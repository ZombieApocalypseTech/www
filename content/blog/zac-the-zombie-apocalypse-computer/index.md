ZAC is a self-contained, open-source survival computer designed to function completely off-grid.

Built around a Raspberry Pi / Mini PC architecture, ZAC lives in a weatherproof Pelican case. Solar and battery powered. No internet required. No cloud dependencies. No subscriptions. A standalone, civilization-in-a-box machine, constructed to outlast the zombie apocalypse.

ZACOS is the software that runs on ZAC and provides a unified interface for all system features:

- Local LLM for questions and assistance (RAG-enabled)
- Offline Wikipedia, survival references, and medical guides
- LoRa mesh communication with any Meshtastic-compatible device
- SDR for monitoring aircraft, weather satellites, and emergency broadcast radio
- GPS navigation with offline maps
- Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure)
- Emergency beacon mode
- Expandable via USB sensor modules

Fully open source. Fully offline. Field-serviceable, including a printed manual with schematics and repair guides. Join our email list to be notified of future updates.

Until then...
