The zombies aren’t just those monsters with rotten faces. The zombies are any force destructive to our world. Eaters of the planet, the mind, and the spirit. That’s why I like to make things beautiful. Especially now. It reminds me of the world we had, the world we lost, and the world as it could be again. Just because things have gone to hell in a handbasket, doesn’t mean we have to give in to the bastards. Don’t ever give in.
