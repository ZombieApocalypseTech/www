[Zombies](/glossary/zombie) aren’t only monsters with rotten faces. They are any force destructive to our world. Eaters of the planet, the body, the mind, and the spirit. That is why I strive to make things beautiful, down to the smallest detail. Especially during times like these. It reminds me of the world we lost, and the world as it could be again. Just because things have gone to hell in a handbasket, doesn’t mean we have to give in to the bastards. Don’t ever give in.
